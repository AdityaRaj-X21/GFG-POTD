# 📚 GeeksForGeeks - Problem of the Day Solutions

Welcome to my repository!  
This repository contains my daily solutions for the **GeeksForGeeks Problem of the Day** challenge.  
I regularly practice these problems to improve my data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills, enhance problem-solving abilities, and stay consistent with coding.

## 📌 About

- Problems are picked from the **GeeksForGeeks POTD** (Problem of the Day).
- Solutions are written in **C++/Java/Python**.
- Each solution is optimized for readability and efficiency.
- Whenever possible, problems are solved using different approaches like brute-force, optimization, and dynamic programming.
